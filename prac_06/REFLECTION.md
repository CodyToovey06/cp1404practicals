# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Making sure that I understand topics well enough to start on work instead of teaching myself while doing it.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Being more responsible with my time - starting the lecture videos, and assignments earlier to ensure I complete them and have plenty of time to refine my work.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been completing all work on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop putting things off and get them done within a reasonable amout of time, giving myself the chance to go back and look over my work.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Overall I feel that not all lecturers stand by the fact that the lecture videos and seminars are different. Most of the time it feels as if it is just repeated without much meaningful expansion.
